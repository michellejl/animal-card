			<p>Narwhals are medium-sized whales with a large horn that grows from a canine tooth. Because of the tusk, narwhals have been nicknamed "Unicorns of the Sea". Although they are definitely real, they are concidered Near Threatened under the criterion of the Internation Union for Conservation of Nature. </p>
